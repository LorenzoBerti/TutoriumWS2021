 * This is an abstract class that implements the methods of the interface

 * this class the implementation of the methods of the interface
 * FinancialProduct because there is no difference in pricing, i.e. the price is
 * given by the expectation under a certain measure of the discounted payoff
 * (discounted with respect the right num√©raire). The only difference between
 * the financial products is in the payoff, thus we write more specific class
 * for that. In order to write the class, in particular the constructor of the
 * class, try to think what really define an option and leave the user as free
 * as possible.
